                            <p>Upon returning to the DC area, I joined Comunidad, a community engagement non-profit. I joined the staff as a Special Projects Coordinator to help further develop a program working with a few students who were learning morse code to help build their confidence in regular reading. I developed a morse-code keyboard to help our team create an original morse-code curriculum for this program. A  highlight was establishing a high school Coding Bootcamp, which I have now been leading two years in a row. Two dozen students come for a weeklong coding bootcamp crash course, working with volunteers, to learn how to build a website or make a game in Python. As a result of this program, multiple students are now going to college to study Computer Science and have the potential to create generational change for them and their families.</p>

                            <h3 id="code-club" style="color: rgba(51,103,214,1);">Code Club</h3>
                            <p>My two budding passions came together in an opportunity to be a part of SU's Center for Community Engagement Student Lead program. Their Youth Initiative was to help support the local community by augmenting educational experiences for the local K-12 schools, some of the most underserved in Seattle. I had the privilege of developing and leading a Python Code Club for Washington Middle Schoolers after school once a week. I got to introduce Python to a dozen students and teach them how to create their own programs and games. The relationship building experiences through the WMS Code Club kept my educational career pursuits alive even as I graduated and moved into the startup tech world.</p>

                            <p>Instructing and counseling at iD Tech was the first place I really learned how to self-manage. Building out my own lesson plans, managing my campers personal projects, and making sure it was all running on time was kind of like running my own mini-startup!</p>

                            <p>Being apart of a community helps to give our life purpose. Being a part of Young Life and sharing faith with my peers was a privilege and something that honestly saved my college experience. Here I learned how valuable showing up even when you don't want to can be.</p>
