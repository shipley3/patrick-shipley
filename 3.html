                        <p>Out of the six core values at Barn2Door, I learned two are the most important, heart and hardy. In order to move the vision of the company forward, those two were essential. Heart for the customer and the mission, this pushes innovation and service on behalf of the customer we were building for. Hardy for when you need to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty, doing the extra work and going above and beyond for our customers.</p>
                        
                        <p>I also learned something pretty valuable at Barn2Door, everyone in the company needs to be a salesperson. Especially if you are customer facing. Even though support isn't the same as sales and account managment, you still need to know and understand the value the product and experience is bringing. This is crucial because it leads to confidence in your conversations with customers. Then you can win customers' trust through their support experiences.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lastly, is empathy. Everything we did in support, I tried to make sure was done with empathy. You literally cannot fix every problem in support, but I made sure our team understood that we can at least be available and listen to our customers.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some projects I am most proud of from my time there:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Building out a product analysis process for abandoned carts on our seller's stores. Bringing those findings to our product team to improve one of the most important product flows on our platform.</li>
                            <li>Creating and Implementing a HubSpot Support Desk using Chat, Forms, Email, and Knowledge Base.</li>
                            <li>Establishing Support key metrics of response time and resolution time. We exceeded those goals for nine months straight.</li>
                            <li>Building out a video-based knowledge base on every key product feature for our customers. Building a rythm to release help artricles with each new engineering release. This sped up self-onboarding for our Success team and customers.</li>
                            <li>Implementing a two pronged approach to supporting our farmers (or sellers) and then additionally their buyers on their Barn2Door stores.</li>
